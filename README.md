# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Website

A full-stack web application that provides **personalized movie recommendations** based on **categories** and **movies you have already watched**.

---

## 🚀 How the Recommendation Works
1. The user selects a **movie category** (e.g. Action, Drama, Sci-Fi).
2. The user selects one or more **movies they have already watched** within that category.
3. The system recommends **similar movies from the same category**, based on similarity to the selected watched movies.

This approach ensures that recommendations stay **relevant**, **consistent in genre**, and **aligned with the user’s taste**.
